# dotfile
All my dotfiles for keeping them all current on various different machines.
As of 12.14.2015, only viminfo, vimrc, and bashrc are included. 
Run install script to make backups of the current files in the home dir, and make sym links to this repo in the home dir.
Uses bash/paths.sh as a listing for all paths used in the script.
